# Hi there üëã

I am Gemma, a senior full-stack software engineer with 12 years experience who has helped teams develop products and software quickly, laying the groundwork that resulted in **20+ services deployed to production** @ [Kamma](https://kammadata.com) in 6 years, and led the delivery of features and releases to over 30+ live in-person event websites with a team of 3 @ WTG within 3 years.

My goal isn't just to produce software, but to:

1. Help teams achieve **optimal product velocity** by improving the developer experience.
2. **Build products** that customers need and are easy to use.
3. **Increase internal productivity** through collaboration, and building/sourcing tools.

I love working with different languages, frameworks and tools across the entire stack including:

## Fun Facts

If you're still reading my profile, I've somewhat managed to come across as remotely interesting.

- I use Plain Text Accounting for simplicity. Kudos to [hledger](https://hledger.org/).
- üá™üá∏ I decided to move to the heart of Spain where no one speaks English. I can attest that my Spanish is improving.
- üî® I'm renovating some beech-wood chairs that I was given for free.
- üéπ I love making music on my phone and once upon a time released loops to practice my production skills @ [Roxxibox Loop](https://www.youtube.com/@RoxxiboxLoop).
- üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª I created a Tailwind analog called [Preons](https://github.com/preons/preons) before I knew it existed, after realizing how useful functional CSS was and needing more flexibility than what [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) provided.
